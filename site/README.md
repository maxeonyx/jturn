# J-Turn Site

This is the J-Turn project website.

## Development
The site is built using Vue.js.

The demos are built separately and added to the final site by the github action, so they will not be available here. Run them independently in their respective directories.

## Usage
To run the site locally:
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

## Deployment
The site is deployed to GitHub Pages via [the GitHub Actions workflow](../.github/workflows/site.yml).
