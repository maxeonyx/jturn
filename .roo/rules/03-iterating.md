# Iteration Strategies

This document outlines the strategies for iterative development in the JJ VCS GUI project. Iteration is key to refining functionality and improving the user experience.

- **Clarify tasks**: Clearly define the goals and requirements for each iteration. Ask questions to the user to ensure you have a complete understanding of the task.
- **Break Down Features**: Divide features into smaller, manageable tasks that can be completed in a single iteration.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Think about the tests before implementing functionality. How should the feature work end-to-end? What are the edge cases?
- **Feedback**: Gather feedback early and often to guide development. If stuck, write specialized code to look directly at the internal state of the application - this is typically very enlightening.
