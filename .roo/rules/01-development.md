# Instructions to the AI Assistant - Development Practices

Other than general coding best practice, we strictly do the following in this project:

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write tests before implementing functionality.

- **Step back and implement a smaller demo**: Before diving into complex features, create a small demo to validate the approach. Every step of a project should feel easy and achievable. See demos/ directory for examples.

## Tools and Frameworks
- **Vue.js**: Frontend development.
- **Rust**: Server-side development and JJ library integration.
- **VSCode Extension**: Extension development.

## Version Control
- Use JJ VCS for version control. See [`notes/jj.md`](notes/jj.md) for an overview.
- Commit frequently with clear and descriptive messages.
- Follow branching strategies for feature development and bug fixes.

## Expansion
As the project evolves, this document will be updated to include specific development practices for new features and components.
