# Development Practices

This document outlines the development practices and strategies for the JJ VCS GUI project. Adhering to these practices ensures high-quality code and seamless collaboration.

## Key Principles
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write tests before implementing functionality.
- **Modular Design**: Develop components that are reusable and maintainable.
- **Code Consistency**: Follow established coding standards and conventions.
- **Documentation**: Document all code and processes thoroughly.
- **Performance Optimization**: Prioritize efficient and performant implementations.

## Development Workflow
1. **Requirements Gathering**: Clearly define the functionality to be implemented.
2. **Step back and implement a smaller demo**: Before diving into complex features, create a small demo to validate the approach. Every step of a project should feel easy and achievable.
3. **Test Plan Creation**: Develop and write down a test plan before starting implementation.
   - Identify edge cases and expected behaviors.
4. **Implementation**: Follow the cycle of **test, develop, iterate**:
   - Write tests first (TDD).
   - Develop functionality to pass the tests.
   - Iterate to refine and optimize the implementation.
5. **Testing**: Validate functionality with automated tests.

## Tools and Frameworks
- **Vue.js**: Frontend development.
- **Rust**: Server-side development and JJ library integration.
- **VSCode Extension**: Extension development.

## Version Control
- Use JJ VCS for version control.
- Commit frequently with clear and descriptive messages.
- Follow branching strategies for feature development and bug fixes.

## Expansion
As the project evolves, this document will be updated to include specific development practices for new features and components.
