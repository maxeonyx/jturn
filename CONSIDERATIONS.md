# J-Turn Implementation Considerations

This document outlines the technical aspects we need to investigate and decide upon before and during implementation. All decisions here are tentative and need further research and discussion.

## Core Technical Decisions

### Graph Visualization
- What are the available approaches for rendering commit graphs in VS Code?
- How to handle:
  - Dynamic updates to the visualization
  - Custom node and connection styling
  - Interactive elements and hit detection
  - Efficient layout calculation
  - Performance with large repositories
  - Custom animations and transitions

### WebView Integration
- How to share WebViews across different VS Code locations:
  - Editor tabs
  - Side panel
  - Bottom panel
  - Custom views
- Can multiple graph views be open simultaneously?
- What's the best way to handle state synchronization between views?
- How to handle WebView persistence across VS Code reload/restart?

### UI Framework Selection
- Evaluate Vue.js suitability for VS Code extensions
- Consider alternatives if needed
- Research VS Code's recommended UI patterns
- How to integrate framework with VS Code's native styling

### VS Code Integration Points

#### SCM API
- How deeply can we integrate with VS Code's SCM features?
- Can we use VS Code's built-in diff viewer?
- How to handle multi-parent merge commits in diff view?
- Integration possibilities with VS Code's native file tree

#### Style System
- How to consume VS Code's theming system
- Ways to maintain consistent styling across different view types
- Handling theme changes
- Accessibility considerations

#### Native Components
- Can we use VS Code's native tree views and explorers?
- How to blend native components with custom graph visualization
- Trade-offs between native components and custom implementations

### Drag and Drop Implementation
- Available drag and drop APIs in VS Code WebViews
- How to handle different drop target types:
  - Merge targets
  - Rebase locations
  - Hunk movement
- Dynamic drop target validation
- Visual feedback during drag operations
- Coordination between drag source and potential targets

### JJ Integration
- Complete feature audit of JJ
- Command line interface patterns
- Performance considerations
- Error handling and recovery
- How to represent JJ-specific concepts visually
- Handling JJ's unique features:
  - Multi-parent merges
  - Undoable operations
  - Workspace concept
  - Remote bookmarks

### State Management
- How to maintain consistent state across views
- Event propagation between components
- Handling concurrent modifications
- Caching and performance optimization
- Undo/redo implementation

### Testing Considerations
- Integration testing with real JJ operations
- WebView testing methodology
- UI interaction testing
- State management testing
- Performance testing with large repositories

### Performance Considerations
- Large repository handling
- Graph rendering optimization
- State update propagation
- Command execution and feedback
- WebView communication overhead

### Error Handling
- JJ operation failures
- Network issues
- Concurrent modification handling
- User feedback mechanisms
- Recovery strategies

## Open Questions

1. **VS Code Integration Depth**
   - How deeply can we integrate with VS Code's diff viewer?
   - Can we extend VS Code's native UI components for our needs?
   - What are the limitations of WebView communication?

2. **UI Framework**
   - Is Vue.js appropriate for VS Code extensions?
   - What are the alternatives?
   - What are the trade-offs?

3. **Visualization Strategy**
   - What approach will best suit our interactive needs?
   - How do we handle complex layouts efficiently?
   - What are the performance trade-offs of different approaches?

4. **Component Architecture**
   - How to structure the application for maximum reuse?
   - What's the best way to share state?
   - How to handle view coordination?

5. **Testing Strategy**
   - What tools are available?
   - How to test WebView interactions?
   - How to ensure reliable JJ integration tests?

## Next Steps

1. Research VS Code extension capabilities and limitations
2. Explore visualization approaches and techniques
3. Create proof-of-concept implementations for key features
4. Test integration points with VS Code's native features
5. Evaluate UI framework options
6. Document findings and make initial technical decisions

Note: All aspects of this implementation plan are subject to change as we learn more about VS Code's extension capabilities and limitations.
